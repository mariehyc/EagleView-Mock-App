# EagleView Mock App

A lightweight **Flask-based mock backend** used to simulate EagleView’s integration with the **ChatGPT Marketplace App (Apps SDK)**. This proof-of-concept demonstrates how ChatGPT could communicate with an external geospatial app through a simple **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** endpoint.

## Overview

This mock app simulates what a real EagleView–ChatGPT integration could look like. It doesn’t call internal services or APIs — instead, it provides **mock responses** to mimic data flow and app discovery behavior.

The app exposes three key routes:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Health check endpoint (returns “✅ Mock app is running!”) |
| `/get_sample_image` | POST | Returns mock property image and summary data for testing integration |
| `/mcp` | GET / POST | Returns metadata that ChatGPT uses to discover app tools and schema |

## Code Summary

### `app.py`
Main Flask application.  
Defines endpoints and returns JSON responses for testing integration. 

### `ai-plugin.json`
Manifest file describing the app to ChatGPT (used for connector discovery).

### `openai.yaml`
Defines the OpenAPI schema for `/get_sample_image`.

## Commands

### Setup environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask flask-cors
```

### Run app 
```bash
python app.py
```

### Local server
``` bash
ngrok http 5003
```
or alternatively
``` bash
npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5003
```

## Integration with ChatGPT (Apps SDK)

Enable Developer Mode in ChatGPT.
1. Go to Settings → Connectors → Create.
2. Use the public tunnel URL (from ngrok or Cloudflare) ending in /mcp.
3. Choose No authentication.
4. Click Create.

If successful, ChatGPT should detect the get_sample_image tool and allow queries like:
```bash
“Show me a sample roof image for Seattle.”
```

## Current Issue

Flask logs show:
``` bash
POST /mcp HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
/mcp endpoint tested successfully via browser
Public HTTPS tunnels (ngrok + Cloudflare) confirmed reachable

However, ChatGPT currently times out during connector creation, even though the mock app responds with valid MCP metadata. Perhaps there is a ChatGPT Apps SDK beta limitation — intermittent timeouts during connector validation, especially when using free or temporary tunnels.
